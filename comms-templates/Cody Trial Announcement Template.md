This is a basic template for a new Cody proof of concept launch; we recommend having your champion post this in Slack or other appropriate channel. Adjust the text as needed; in particular, change `<<Customer>>`, `<<Sourcegraph Instance URL>>`, `<<Login method, usually code host OAuth>>`.

**We have enabled Cody to improve developer productivity at `<<Customer>>`!**

**What is Cody?**

Cody is an AI coding assistant that utilizes Sourcegraph's code graph and Large Language Models (LLMs) to write code and provide answers based on your codebase.

Think of Cody as your personal dedicated AI coding assistant, equipped with a comprehensive understanding of three crucial elements:

* Your entire codebase
* Vast knowledge of open source code
* Extensive training data for code understanding and problem-solving

Cody helps you answer questions, write code, and offer suggestions for code improvement.

We believe that providing the right context makes a big impact on the ability of an AI model to provide accurate responses to the tasks we ask it to carry out. If you would like to dive a little deeper into how we do this take a look at the following white paper, **[Cody Context Architecture](https://about.sourcegraph.com/whitepaper/cody-context-architecture.pdf)**

**Configuring Cody**

***How to get up and running with Cody?***

You can use Cody in two ways. Via the Cody tab in the Sourcegraph UI or via an extension to your IDE. To use the Web UI simply navigate to your Sourcegraph instance using the link below and login using `<<Login method, usually code host OAuth>>`

- **`<<Sourcegraph Instance URL>>`**

To use Cody via your IDE you need to:

* Obtain an access token from your Sourcegraph instance. Navigate to your Sourcegraph instance, select Settings via your profile and then Access Token
* Download and install the extension for your IDE, currently we have support for Visual Studio Code and JetBrains
* Connect your extension to your Sourcegraph instance using the access token
