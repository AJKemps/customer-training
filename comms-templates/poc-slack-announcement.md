## Customer Slack annnouncement for PoC

This is a basic template for a new proof of concept launch; we recommend having your champion post this in Slack. Adjust the text as needed; in particular, change `<<Customer>>`, `<<Instance URL>>`, `<<Login method, usually code host OAuth>>`, and the Slack channel URL and name to reflect their actual values. We also recommend customizing the use case list (the first three bullet points) to match the customer's focus.

**We have deployed Sourcegraph to improve developer productivity & experience for all of `<<Customer>>` Engineering!**

**Sourcegraph** is a **universal code search, intelligence, batch changes, and insights** tool for engineers. It will allow you to:

- Quickly and easily search, explore, and understand code across all of our repos, history, and branches
- Automate large scale code changes
- Track and analyze the current state of our codebase & changes over time (ex: migrations, package use, version adoption, code smells, codebase size)

**Sourcegraph is available now** for a 1-month trial, and we’ll continue with Sourcegraph if it’s useful.

**Accessing Sourcegraph:**

- Click here: (**`<<Instance URL>>`**) and log in with `<<Login method, usually code host OAuth>>`

**Recommended set-up (optional):**

- Install the [Sourcegraph browser extension](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_extension) and point it at our instance to enable code intelligence directly in GitHub
- VSCode users should [install the VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.sourcegraph) for a completely in-IDE version of Sourcegraph
- Everyone else should enable the Sourcegraph to IDE extension for your IDE at **`<<Instance URL>>`/extensions?category=Code+editors** . Enable the IDE to Sourcegraph extension from your IDE’s extension marketplace as well. These extensions will allow you to quickly jump between your IDE and Sourcegraph.
