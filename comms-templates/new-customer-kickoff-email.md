Hi `<<Contact>>`,

So glad to hear that we're going to be working together going forward!

For the kickoff, here’s the structure we’ve found most successful:

## `<<Customer>>` contacts
*Executive Sponsor - you*

- Sets program goals
- Has direct access to Sourcegraph leadership
- Able to navigate & address blockers

*Project Owner - typically a Director, Manager, or Tech Lead on an Engineering Services, Infra, DevOps, or Dev Productivity team*

- Partners with Sourcegraph to drive awareness & adoption

*Technical Owner - typically an Engineer on the Engineering Services, Infra, DevOps, or Dev Productivity team*

- Partners with Sourcegraph to make any changes to `<<Customer>>`’s technical deployment and configuration of Sourcegraph. Example tasks: setting up [Precise Code Intelligence](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_intelligence/explanations/precise_code_intelligence) and setting up extensions with 3rd party tools like Datadog

## Agenda
*Align on program goals*

- We have done much of this together during the POC and understand that `<<Customer>>` would like to use Sourcegraph to `<<stated goals from PoC>>`. I want to make sure that we thoroughly understand your expectations and any additional or more specific focus areas and milestones you have in mind.
- We could either discuss this live in the meeting, or would appreciate any thoughts you can share over email if you don’t think it makes sense to join the meeting and would prefer to leave the meeting to the team

*Align on enablement strategy*

- We’ll come to the meeting with a proposed enablement plan with the goal of tweaking that to match your team’s preferences so that we can leave the meeting with a complete plan that we can execute together.
- Example plan:
- Sourcegraph announcement by `<<Champion>>` in next Eng All Hands to amplify the announcement you just sent out
- Sourcegraph docs + Slack channel link added to `<<Customer>>` onboarding docs + internal wiki
- Training series: Global lunch and learn (Sourcegraph 101 and 102), admin trainings, team-specific trainings, use case-specific trainings
- Regular cadence scheduled with Project Owner to track progress and iterate based on feedback

*Align on remaining configuration and technical topics*

- Examples:
- Set up Precise Code Intelligence
- Set up extensions with 3rd party tools like Datadog
- Partner with `<<Customer>>` IT to enable Sourcegraph browser extension globally

We are ultimately happy to structure this however best serves `<<Customer>>` and hope this serves as a great starting point.

Let me know of any feedback, who should be involved, and the best way to schedule.
