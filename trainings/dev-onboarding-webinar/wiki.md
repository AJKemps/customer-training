## Searching code with Sourcegraph

Sourcegraph has been selected as our code search and navigation platform. Sourcegraph allows you to search across all of our code in the browser or via a CLI, without needing to have it stored locally. Sourcegraph is one of the most valuable tools you have to onboard yourself into our code. 

## Accessing Sourcegraph

Sourcegraph can be accessed in the browser at **SOURCEGRAPH URL**. You'll authenticate using **AUTHENTICATION METHOD**.

Additionally, if you're using VSCode or JetBrains, you can search Sourcegraph from within your editor:

* [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.sourcegraph)
* [JetBrains Extension](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9682-sourcegraph)

They also offer a CLI:

* [Sourcegraph CLI](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/cli)

## Browser Extension

Regardless of what editor you use, you will benefit from installing Sourcegraph's [browser extension](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_extension). The extension gives you access to Sourcegraph's [code navigation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_intelligence) functionality when viewing code in **CODE HOST NAME** as you have access to in Sourcegraph.
